							<h1><span>Dissertation Projects</span></h1>
							<p>During my time in University, I have completed two dissertation projects. These both represent my largest pieces of work and demonstrate best my ability to organise, plan, and prioritise my time effectively to achieve a high standard of work.</p>
							<p>In the final-year of my undergraduate program, there was an opportunity to complete a research placement with a partner company, which would involve a blend of practical work experience alongside the completion of a dissertation project. I was one of six students academically eligible to take this module, however the work experience element was cancelled due to the pandemic. My <a href="Research-on-staff-retention-as-well-as-experience-with-Catch22-1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>undergrad dissertation</b></a> was an investigation into staff retention rates for the partner organisation, for which I designed a survey through Qualtrics to analyse quantitative data from over 80 participants, receiving a first-class grade. My work with statistics continued into my Master's programme, which you can view <a href="generic 5.html"><b>here.</b></a></p>
							<p>My <a href="WfW-Dissertation-Project.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Master's dissertation</b></a> was my most intensive and challenging project to date, yet it was my most enjoyable. I completed an analysis of Welsh afforestation policy and produced a report assessing how it has evolved to be able to satisfy current government tree planting targets. I utilised semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders to support my findings from my policy analysis. I received a merit for my efforts for which one of my markers noted that "there is an assured skill here in writing a policy report that is quite impressive". This is my proudest piece of work to date, but I have written a variety of <a href="reports.html"><b>reports</b></a> that I believe are great at further showcasing my written language, research, and report writing skills </span></p>
