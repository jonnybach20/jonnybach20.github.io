							<h1><span>Technical Support Officer at the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority</span></span></h1>
                            				<p>I support the work of my colleagues who are responsible for the development of the National Park Authorityâ€™s Strategic Plans by preparing and maintaining extensive datasets using primary and secondary data sources, and using GIS to produce graphical representation of data.</p>
							<p>I also provide the department administration by, for example, processing orders and payments and organising meetings and taking minutes.</p>
							<p>I am responsible for updating the team's publicised information on the Authority's website using WordPress. Check out this lengthly <a href="https://www.pembrokeshirecoast.wales/pembrokeshire-green-infrastructure-assessment/" target="_blank"><b>Green Infrustructure Assessment</b></a> I was tasked with uploading in both English and Welsh!
							<p>Regarding my involvment in development planning, I support the preparation of the National Park's strategic plans for development as set out in the Authority's Local Development Plan 2 (LDP2). As of now, I have started preparations for the required review of the LDP2 and will be involved in supporting the review process. I have produced web-based research that will be used to inform new policy positions and or draft supplementary planning guidances adopted during the review stage or in preparation of LDP 3. For instance, as an area with high percenatges of second homes and holiday lets, I was asked to search for and summarise other local authority's policies to inform a review of our stance on a <a href="Principal Residence_Local Connection.pdf" target="_blank"><b>principal residence/local connections policy</b></a>.</p>
						    	<p>The National Park Auhtority is required to monitor and review the performance of its Local Development Plan annually. I am responsible for organising the public consultation of the Annual Monitoring Report and organising representations into a report for Officers to comment on. I format agreed amendments and produce the final Annual Monitoring Report. I was also involved in the monitoring activity, undertaking onsite survey work to monitor changes in the community in respect to retail, housing trajectories and community facilities. </p>
